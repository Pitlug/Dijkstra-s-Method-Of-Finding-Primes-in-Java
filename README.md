# Dijkstra-s-Method-Of-Finding-Primes-in-Java
My compsci professor in class challenged us to find all the primes up to a million using Dijkstra's method of finding primes during class. So I took it upon myself to figure this out. I watched b001's video "Dijkstra's Hidden Prime Finding Algorithm" https://youtu.be/fwxjMKBMR7s?si=YkLDC74sZDgAV6xU
